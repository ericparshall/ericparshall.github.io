<p>
  While getting my system set up to develop for Ruby on Rails on Debian 6 I encountered this error after running "gem install rails":
</p>

<pre>
ERROR: Loading command: install (LoadError)
no such file to load -- zlib
ERROR: While executing gem ... (NameError)
uninitialized constant Gem::Commands::InstallCommand
</pre>

<p>
  I found the fix I needed at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1494997, specifically: "Try installing libzlib-ruby from apt-get."
</p>

<p>
  I already had installed Ruby 1.9.3 using RVM. Following advice on another post I first removed ruby with the command "rvm remove 1.9.3" and then installed zlib with the command "sudo apt-get install libzlib-ruby" and then re-installed ruby with the command "rvm install 1.9.3 --default". I was then able to successfully install rails with "gem install rails".
</p>

<p>
  However, I proceeded to receive this message after using the command "bundle install":
</p>

<pre>
ERROR:  Error installing pg:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
</pre>

<p>
  I found the solution to this problem at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6040583/unable-to-install-pg-gem-on-ubuntu, specifically:
</p>

<pre>
I had tried gem install libpq-dev
but I got:
Can't find the 'libpq-fe.h header
*** extconf.rb failed ***
but I found that sudo (which I try to avoid using with RoR) worked with:
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
then I could do
gem install pg
without issue.
</pre>

<p>
  So I installed libpq-dev using "sudo apt-get install libpq-dev" and then "gem install pg".  I was then able to do "bundle install" on my rails app.
</p>

<p>So the general steps are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install RVM</li>
  <li>sudo apt-get install libzlib-ruby</li>
  <li>rvm install 1.9.3 --default</li>
  <li>gem install rails</li>
  <li>sudo apt-get install libpq-dev</li>
  <li>gem install pg</li>
</ol>

<p>After this I was up and running. Hopes this helps!</p>
